Hyperledger hosts a Grid chat channel and a mailing list. These tools require a
free [Linux Foundation ID](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org). The Grid project
also hosts Zoom meetings for contributors.

## Chat

[The #grid channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid) is the place to
go for up-to-the-minute Hyperledger Grid discussions, from quick help to
involved conversations.

## Mailing List

[The Hyperledger Grid mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/grid)
provides a forum for both simple questions and more complex discussions.

## Grid Community Meetings

This project hosts Grid community meetings on Zoom. For meeting announcements,
see the [Hyperledger meeting
calendar](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings)
or the [Grid mailing
list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/grid). Lurkers are welcome! Feel free to
just listen.
